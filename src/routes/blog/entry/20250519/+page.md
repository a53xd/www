title: "my dream of having a porsche"

during the weekend, i found myself being on the porsche configurator waaaaaaaaaaaay too much. i may have configured about 20 porsches, but at the end, one particular porsche stood out, which is now my dream.

## The Porsche Taycan Turbo GT

it's electric, but holy crap is it powerful. with 1034hp, i'm pretty sure porsche is making their electric cars better than their gas cars, with the 911 carrera 4 gts having half of that in HP.

because of the need to make your own car in porsche configurator, i can't exactly decribe the design, but if you want, the porsche code for it is PT7PR965.

and that's dreams, folks!
bye.
